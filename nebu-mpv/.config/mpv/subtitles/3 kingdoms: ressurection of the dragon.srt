1
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,638
228 A.D.

2
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,474
It was a time when China was divided
between Three Kingdoms, Wei, Wu and Shu

3
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:23,577
The country was plagued by constant war while
its people suffered from hardship and famine

4
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:28,982
It was from this turmoil that a hero would arise

5
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,821
His name was Zhao Zilong of Shu Kingdom

6
00:02:57,946 --> 00:03:05,653
I vow to guard Phoenix Heights to my death.

7
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:14,996
I vow to capture Zhao Zilong alive today!

8
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:55,905
We only have one life to live

9
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,140
I, Luo Pingan of Changshan

10
00:03:58,641 --> 00:03:59,875
shall dream big

11
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:01,277
and aspire

12
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,012
after success

13
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:06,182
Just as a dog needs to find a good master

14
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:08,350
So had I chosen to join Liu's forces

15
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:12,488
It was there that I met Zilong

16
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:20,164
Your home village?

17
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:21,332
Changshan

18
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:23,701
Your name?

19
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:24,802
Zhao Zilong

20
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:28,506
How long have you been away from home?

21
00:04:29,874 --> 00:04:32,109
Almost two years

22
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:34,475
Why do you want to join Liu's army?

23
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:36,444
To bring peace

24
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:38,580
to our land and start a family

25
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,848
Do you think we can win?

26
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:46,788
I believe that man can prevail over destiny

27
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:52,562
"Changshan Zhao Zilong"

28
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:58,835
This is the frontline of Liu's army

29
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:01,938
Cao's army is much stronger
and determined to eliminate Liu

30
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,908
Liu rushes the fortress fortification

31
00:05:05,175 --> 00:05:07,544
while we wait for backup forces

32
00:05:58,096 --> 00:05:58,996
We're here

33
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:03,534
Then where is Changshan?
It must be here

34
00:06:05,436 --> 00:06:06,838
Changshan's not there at all

35
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,010
You fool...

36
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:12,512
You should know more about your own country

37
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:25,188
Changshan is here

38
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,597
This bread is tasteless

39
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,670
I am from Changshan too.

40
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:45,878
We are now here

41
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:50,082
If we fight for our Lord Liu
and make a circle on this map

42
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:52,251
Peace will finally come to our country

43
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:55,921
And we can return to Changshan as heroes

44
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:07,001
Can we really encircle so much territory?

45
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:15,476
Young man, you stick with me your brother

46
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,912
And I'll lead you to complete that circle

47
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:21,445
Brother

48
00:07:24,248 --> 00:07:25,283
How long have you been in the army?

49
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,151
Five years

50
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:28,786
Do you ever miss home?

51
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,390
Who wouldn't?

52
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,229
But I've never been back

53
00:07:36,963 --> 00:07:38,031
A man must dream big

54
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:42,802
And aspire after great achievements

55
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:47,774
I swore not to return home unless with glory

56
00:07:58,251 --> 00:07:59,085
Brother...

57
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:02,524
Consider this a gift to you

58
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:03,792
For me?

59
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:07,996
The map is in my heart

60
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,969
"When the fort falls Annihilation follows"

61
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,804
Look, what's in the box?

62
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:52,773
How would I know?

63
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,008
And who is that man?

64
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:09,522
What's the matter?

65
00:09:09,822 --> 00:09:10,623
It's Pingan!

66
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,091
Strange things happened

67
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:14,661
A wooden box was left
outside the front gate

68
00:09:14,928 --> 00:09:16,996
And there's someone sent by Lord Liu

69
00:09:18,598 --> 00:09:19,332
Is he the reinforcement?

70
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,100
Does he look like one?

71
00:09:26,007 --> 00:09:26,875
How many people did he bring with him?

72
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:28,143
He came alone

73
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:30,312
Alone?

74
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,582
The main force of Cao's army

75
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:36,218
will attack us within the next few days

76
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,552
So they won't wait long

77
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,123
Cao's army will attack us tomorrow

78
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:46,328
What should we do?

79
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:04,111
There must be four thousand
men in the Cao's camp

80
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:05,546
Definitely not less than eight thousand

81
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:09,083
How can you be so sure?

82
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:14,388
At ten men per cooking stove

83
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:18,761
Cao's army has lit over a
thousand stoves to cook a meal

84
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:20,263
That makes ten thousand troops?

85
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:25,134
I didn't want to scare you with the numbers

86
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:27,970
Then we are doomed

87
00:10:30,438 --> 00:10:33,075
Cao's ten thousand men is nothing

88
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:36,679
Cao is a master in the art of war,
but he is skeptical by nature

89
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:39,715
His troops could have traveled 25 miles a day

90
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,052
But now they're traveling only 8 miles a day

91
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:46,391
It is obvious that he has his concerns

92
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:48,493
What concerns would a dog like Cao have?

93
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:52,197
He is afraid of someone in our army

94
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,298
Who is that?

95
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:54,766
Liu's Military Advisor

96
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:58,269
Zhuge Liang!

97
00:11:03,238 --> 00:11:07,075
Battle and chess are similar

98
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:09,010
Instead of hanging onto every
chess piece and playing defensively

99
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:11,046
One must know when to sacrifice a rook

100
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,352
to take the opponent's king

101
00:11:16,086 --> 00:11:19,389
So to live, we must give up this camp

102
00:11:20,657 --> 00:11:21,592
Can we win?

103
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:24,528
Would I come to die if we can't win?

104
00:11:25,095 --> 00:11:28,398
Like playing chess it's better
to lose the rook than the game

105
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:34,338
We shall head off their
attack by hitting them tonight

106
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:37,007
But we only have one thousand men

107
00:11:37,274 --> 00:11:40,579
It can't be done except tonight

108
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:45,718
I predict that at midnight tonight,
there will be a thunderstorm

109
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:50,723
This presents us a great opportunity

110
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:56,759
But do you have enough
courage to act on it?

111
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:59,428
We the Changshan soldiers
are made of courage

112
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:01,164
But what if it doesn't rain?

113
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:05,668
Should there be no rain at midnight tonight.
I shall be beheaded!

114
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,842
Zhuge Liang!

115
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:23,054
Hurry to the Cao's camp before it rains

116
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:31,596
490 of us shall form the Dragon unit.
Wait in ambush at the left of Cao's camp

117
00:12:35,402 --> 00:12:41,641
Another 490 of Tiger unit wait in
ambush at the right of Cao's camp

118
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:46,580
The remaining 20 Changshan
soldiers will be the commando unit

119
00:12:47,147 --> 00:12:50,881
We will force our way through
Cao's camp with the rain as signal

120
00:12:51,114 --> 00:12:53,283
When the enemy is in
disarray because of the storm

121
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:57,254
We will cut down the enemy's general flag

122
00:12:57,521 --> 00:12:59,923
and sap their fighting spirit

123
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:02,061
Then Dragon and Tiger units will attack together

124
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:06,532
Despite their numbers, we shall have our victory

125
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:51,042
Life is like a game of chess,
It takes only a single move to win

126
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:55,813
The battle is over.
I shall be off to rescue other places!

127
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:12,933
My Changshan brothers, attack!

128
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:39,692
Attack!

129
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,667
Zilong, come with me.

130
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:49,969
You go chop down their general's flag,
I will kill the vanguard's leader.

131
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:51,136
Brother

132
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,138
Brother, I'll help you

133
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:37,184
Brother...

134
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,204
The leader has been killed

135
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,175
Dragon unit! Attack!

136
00:16:35,176 --> 00:16:37,311
Tiger unit! Attack!

137
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:41,415
I shall launch another attack

138
00:16:47,023 --> 00:16:50,226
Zilong has never told anyone about helping me

139
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:52,795
And I received all the credit

140
00:16:58,201 --> 00:17:01,971
The defeat of Cao's forces enraged Cao.
He decided to personally lead a massive army

141
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:04,274
He vow to defeat Liu

142
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,378
As Cao's army was drawing near

143
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,217
Liu was chased to Phoenix Heights

144
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:22,360
with his people

145
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:25,527
Liu's blood brothers,
Generals Guan Yu and Zhang Fei

146
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:28,997
Were sent to cover the people's retreat

147
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:34,636
My people are suffering because of me.
Advisor, what is your suggestion?

148
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:48,219
My Lord Liu, a proper result can't
be obtained from my divination

149
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,891
Our success in killing the Cao's vanguard
earned me the trust of the Advisor

150
00:17:54,191 --> 00:17:57,795
And the important duty of protecting Liu's family

151
00:17:58,062 --> 00:17:59,763
was assigned to me

152
00:18:00,297 --> 00:18:04,604
Finally,
the opportunity to prove my might had come

153
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:09,942
As for Zilong,
I sent him to assist the refugees

154
00:18:20,617 --> 00:18:23,419
Brother, what should we do?
Are we lost?

155
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:24,554
Let's go back the way we came

156
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:27,690
Brother, are you sure?
We need to be more careful!

157
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:29,859
Back the way we came I said!

158
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:31,094
Yes, Brother!

159
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,473
I saw a Cao army unit coming after us

160
00:18:52,384 --> 00:18:53,018
My Lord!

161
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:55,253
Cao's forces shall be here in no time

162
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:56,888
We must close the front gate at once

163
00:18:57,189 --> 00:18:58,156
The gate can't be closed!

164
00:18:59,593 --> 00:19:01,328
Your wives and child have yet to arrive

165
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:02,496
We must protect the people

166
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:03,297
Brother

167
00:19:03,564 --> 00:19:04,264
Close the gate!

168
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:09,703
Cao's army is approaching, save yourself!

169
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,139
Come in quickly, we're closing the gate.
Come in quickly!

170
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:15,606
Zilong!

171
00:19:23,848 --> 00:19:25,048
Brother!

172
00:19:25,949 --> 00:19:27,209
Zilong!

173
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,948
Brother!

174
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:30,523
We were attacked by Cao's soldiers

175
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:43,369
Where are the two ladies and the young lord?

176
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:48,174
I've lost them

177
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:54,582
Zhang Fei!

178
00:20:01,623 --> 00:20:02,457
How dare you to defy me?

179
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,993
To kill him, you'll have to kill me first

180
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:06,085
Stop it!

181
00:21:07,787 --> 00:21:08,254
Zhang Fei!

182
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,861
You brat!

183
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:46,229
Your skill was outstanding, young man

184
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:51,902
Brothers, lay down your weapons

185
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,578
My people are suffering because of me

186
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:08,315
I am to be blamed for all this

187
00:22:14,156 --> 00:22:16,492
I'm willing to go look for the young
lord on behalf of Luo Pingan

188
00:22:19,495 --> 00:22:22,464
Bestow my armor upon this young man

189
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:24,033
Young man

190
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:28,070
We will clear the way for you

191
00:22:28,304 --> 00:22:28,737
Great!

192
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:35,744
Eat well and fight with a full stomach

193
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:14,084
Brother, don't worry about me

194
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,053
I have nothing to lose

195
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:21,057
I came with nothing and shall leave nothing

196
00:23:22,225 --> 00:23:23,560
There's nothing to worry about

197
00:23:24,661 --> 00:23:28,797
Brother, I want you to
complete the circle without me.

198
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:31,067
Promise me, you'll finish it?

199
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:32,402
You coward!

200
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,706
Don't talk rubbish!

201
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:43,315
Remember, ride swiftly and carefully

202
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:50,386
Bring back the young lord

203
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:02,633
I believe that man

204
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:04,402
can prevail over destiny

205
00:24:26,991 --> 00:24:29,662
Little brother, go bring the royal family

206
00:24:30,597 --> 00:24:31,764
Will we have the chance
to see each other again?

207
00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:34,400
When our missions are accomplished

208
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:36,269
we shall meet again

209
00:25:00,392 --> 00:25:01,660
Behold, I am the great General Zhang

210
00:25:01,994 --> 00:25:03,495
Who dares to challenge me to a duel?

211
00:26:48,102 --> 00:26:51,472
My little granddaughter Cao Ying,
One day you shall be a leader.

212
00:26:51,972 --> 00:26:54,175
Therefore,
you need to study the art of war.

213
00:26:56,277 --> 00:26:56,844
Cao

214
00:26:57,144 --> 00:26:58,412
Zhang Fei, let's go

215
00:27:01,348 --> 00:27:05,082
Lord Cao, our vanguard was
attacked and had to withdraw.

216
00:27:05,252 --> 00:27:07,955
They killed Liu's wives
but failed to find his son

217
00:27:22,605 --> 00:27:23,339
I'm counting on you

218
00:27:39,586 --> 00:27:40,587
Capture that man!

219
00:27:41,054 --> 00:27:41,389
Yes!

220
00:29:02,338 --> 00:29:03,908
Regardless of my success or
failure in rescuing the young lord

221
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,513
Please spare Luo Pingan of any punishment

222
00:29:37,674 --> 00:29:40,410
Look, there is no mercy in war

223
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:43,646
Everyone you see down there
are nothing but chess pieces

224
00:29:44,515 --> 00:29:46,416
I would rather fail everyone in the world

225
00:29:47,184 --> 00:29:49,820
than to allow them to fail me

226
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:52,823
Send out a chariot to catch the man!

227
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,714
Grandfather!

228
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:24,850
Didn't I asked you to captured this man?

229
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:47,506
What is your name, mighty warrior?

230
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:49,610
Zhao Zilong of Changshan

231
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:51,812
Zhao Zilong

232
00:31:53,548 --> 00:31:56,217
One day, you will be captured by me

233
00:31:59,554 --> 00:32:00,855
Only if you live long enough

234
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,156
Zilong made a name for himself

235
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,724
With the rescue of the young lord,
We must gain big credits.

236
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,496
Well, Zilong was the one to do it.
I envied him.

237
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,102
Finally, Changshan had its hero

238
00:32:16,636 --> 00:32:18,738
He returned to Changshan with glory

239
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:24,110
Zilong was invited by his townsmen

240
00:32:29,382 --> 00:32:30,483
Zhao Zilong, our hero

241
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:33,053
He returned to Changshan with glory.
We have something special for you!

242
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:34,154
Yes, it's very good

243
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:37,357
This way please

244
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,021
Here comes our mighty warrior!

245
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,526
I am Zhao Zilong!

246
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,027
Watch out for my sword!

247
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:14,061
Beware of my spear!

248
00:34:05,111 --> 00:34:05,712
Wretch

249
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:11,920
How could you drop our great
hero Changshan's Zhao Zilong?

250
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:15,457
It's alright, it happens

251
00:34:15,724 --> 00:34:17,292
How can Zhao Zilong lose?

252
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,261
At least it shouldn't happen in our hands

253
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:20,529
Continue with the music

254
00:35:36,441 --> 00:35:37,142
Why don't you eat?

255
00:35:40,545 --> 00:35:44,913
Who knows when I can cook for you again?

256
00:35:47,149 --> 00:35:49,051
Lord Liu said our country will unite soon

257
00:35:50,686 --> 00:35:52,221
My work will be done then

258
00:35:52,754 --> 00:35:53,589
I'll come back for you

259
00:35:54,122 --> 00:35:56,160
And we'll never be apart again

260
00:36:00,531 --> 00:36:01,098
I'll wait for you

261
00:36:05,202 --> 00:36:06,170
Come, let's eat

262
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:17,848
"East, West, South, North"

263
00:36:28,794 --> 00:36:32,466
"May we meet and never part again"

264
00:36:32,932 --> 00:36:34,300
I made this for you

265
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:36,502
Carry it with you

266
00:36:48,611 --> 00:36:51,550
It means no matter how fast or far you go,

267
00:36:53,151 --> 00:36:56,021
You'll always find your way back to me.

268
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:01,660
Zhao Zilong was both brave and wise

269
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,063
And never lost a battle against Cao's army

270
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,500
Finally, he became one of
the Five Tiger Generals

271
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:11,736
And earned wide respect
and praise from his people

272
00:37:40,998 --> 00:37:43,701
The world long united must divide.
The long divided must unite!

273
00:37:44,235 --> 00:37:46,906
All the three warlords wished to
become the Emperor of a unified China

274
00:37:48,107 --> 00:37:51,444
Liu Bei became the emperor
of his newly found

275
00:37:51,944 --> 00:37:53,012
Shu Kingdom

276
00:37:53,613 --> 00:37:56,549
The country had been
more chaotic than ever

277
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,552
At His Majesty's command

278
00:37:59,852 --> 00:38:01,921
The title Forward General is
conferred upon Guan Yu

279
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,924
He is to lead 100 thousand troops

280
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:07,426
To guard against Sun of Eastern Kingdom of Wu

281
00:38:25,146 --> 00:38:27,812
Guan Yu, at His Majesty's service

282
00:38:28,813 --> 00:38:29,781
At His Majesty's command

283
00:38:30,315 --> 00:38:32,450
The title Right General is
conferred upon Zhang Fei

284
00:38:32,951 --> 00:38:34,319
He is to lead 100 thousand troops

285
00:38:34,586 --> 00:38:38,156
To guard against Cao Cao
of Northern Kingdom of Wei

286
00:38:39,224 --> 00:38:40,225
At His Majesty's command

287
00:38:40,761 --> 00:38:42,863
The title Left General is conferred upon Ma Chao

288
00:38:43,163 --> 00:38:46,266
He is to lead 50 thousand troops to guard Xichuan

289
00:38:47,634 --> 00:38:48,769
At His Majesty's command

290
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:51,405
The title Guard General is
conferred upon Huang Zhong

291
00:38:51,672 --> 00:38:53,106
He is to lead 50 thousand troops

292
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,741
To guard Zhongjun

293
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:00,013
At His Majesty's command

294
00:39:00,514 --> 00:39:03,483
The title of Flying General is
conferred upon Zhao Zilong

295
00:39:04,351 --> 00:39:05,853
He is to lead the rest of the army

296
00:39:06,587 --> 00:39:08,657
To go on the north expedition against Cao

297
00:39:37,785 --> 00:39:40,522
I hereby further bestow upon General Zilong.
The title Chief Vanguard!

298
00:39:42,157 --> 00:39:44,559
He and his troops are to set off today

299
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:47,629
for the northern expedition against Cao

300
00:39:48,363 --> 00:39:49,864
Zhao Zilong of Changshan at His Majesty's service

301
00:39:50,465 --> 00:39:52,099
Luo Pingan of Changshan at His Majesty's service

302
00:39:58,773 --> 00:40:02,843
The Five Tiger Generals went off
in service of Liu Bei and his people

303
00:40:04,014 --> 00:40:05,882
Over the next twenty years

304
00:40:06,149 --> 00:40:07,884
Only to fall one by one

305
00:40:08,618 --> 00:40:11,886
First, the brave Guan Yu.

306
00:40:13,924 --> 00:40:18,524
Next, the strong Zhang Fei.
They fought valiantly against the enemies of peace.

307
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,629
Soon the only Five Tiger General left standing

308
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:25,465
It was Zhao Zilong of Changshan

309
00:40:37,913 --> 00:40:41,684
Our late Emperor Liu had ascended
to heaven amid his great agenda

310
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:45,354
Over the years, I've launched numerous
northern expeditions but all in vain

311
00:40:46,088 --> 00:40:51,794
The Five Tiger Generals
Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Ma Chao and Huang Zhong

312
00:40:52,528 --> 00:40:54,163
Have all passed away one after the other

313
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:58,169
For which,
I should have been punished by death

314
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,443
However, I assist our young Emperor

315
00:41:05,776 --> 00:41:09,046
To follow late Liu's will

316
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,348
To continue with the northern expedition

317
00:41:14,082 --> 00:41:17,452
And to fulfill our late Liu's dream
of bringing peace to our country.

318
00:41:22,457 --> 00:41:23,791
At His Majesty's command

319
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:32,369
The title Dragon General is
conferred upon the son of Guan Yu

320
00:41:32,636 --> 00:41:36,808
The title Tiger General is
conferred upon on the son of Zhang Fei

321
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:42,979
Together they shall depart today
for the northern expedition against Cao

322
00:41:53,592 --> 00:41:54,726
How dare you cut in before me?

323
00:41:56,128 --> 00:41:58,030
My father is Guan Yu, the head of
"The Five Tiger Generals"

324
00:41:58,797 --> 00:42:01,433
I should be the one to accept the General's seal

325
00:42:03,202 --> 00:42:05,771
I am older and a better fighter than you

326
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:08,604
I should be the one to hold the General's seal.

327
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:11,506
Are you a better fighter than me?

328
00:42:13,876 --> 00:42:14,910
Do you dare to fight me?

329
00:42:16,312 --> 00:42:18,781
Alright, let us fight right here before everyone

330
00:42:18,948 --> 00:42:20,482
and the winner shall bear the General's Seal

331
00:42:31,996 --> 00:42:32,530
Stop!

332
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,404
Uncle!

333
00:42:41,873 --> 00:42:44,475
The leadership of our forces
should never be belittled

334
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:54,888
I have fought hundreds of battles

335
00:42:55,121 --> 00:42:56,756
since I began serving the late Lord Liu

336
00:42:57,323 --> 00:42:58,525
And I have never been defeated

337
00:43:00,493 --> 00:43:03,727
How can I be excluded from the expedition?

338
00:43:05,362 --> 00:43:09,032
General Zilong is the sole survivor of our great
"Five Tiger Generals"

339
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,134
Also you're no longer a young soldier

340
00:43:12,168 --> 00:43:13,503
Should anything go awry

341
00:43:13,937 --> 00:43:17,342
Not only would your reputation be tarnished

342
00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:19,744
But our troops would also be demoralized

343
00:43:21,513 --> 00:43:24,983
After years of trials and tribulations,

344
00:43:26,618 --> 00:43:30,055
Just on the verge of success
in unifying the country

345
00:43:33,058 --> 00:43:34,926
I must be included in
this northern expedition

346
00:43:37,996 --> 00:43:41,433
Zilong, at our age

347
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:45,005
We live by the great memories of our past

348
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:52,574
Do you really want to risk losing
them all by going on this expedition?

349
00:43:54,982 --> 00:43:58,549
After all these years of battle,
my memories of the past have long faded.

350
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:10,923
I want to recover those distant and blurred
memories on the battlefield where they were lost.

351
00:44:12,999 --> 00:44:14,333
Prime Minister

352
00:44:15,835 --> 00:44:18,538
this is my very last battle

353
00:44:19,205 --> 00:44:24,608
I vow to unite the country for Liu's Kingdom,
Zhao Zilong of Changshan at his Majesty's Service.

354
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,322
General, if you insist on going to battle,

355
00:44:36,656 --> 00:44:40,794
Then you shall be accompanied and assisted
by the sons of Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.

356
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:44,266
Zilong I have two pouches for you

357
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:49,737
When you come across the first fork in the road,
Open the first pouch.

358
00:44:50,572 --> 00:44:55,274
Open the second pouch
when you run into extreme difficulties!

359
00:44:59,578 --> 00:45:01,713
Zhao Zilong of Changshan at His Majesty's service

360
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,389
Luo Pingan of Changshan at His Majesty's service

361
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:14,693
General's oath has been repeated many times,
But nothing has been done.

362
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:17,565
We have never served together in the same unit

363
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,767
since Zilong became one of
"The Five Tiger Generals"

364
00:45:20,034 --> 00:45:22,937
But I have always been
watching him from a distance

365
00:45:52,932 --> 00:45:54,167
"Guan Yu"

366
00:46:05,046 --> 00:46:08,283
"Zhang Fei"

367
00:46:09,918 --> 00:46:13,588
"Huang Zhong"

368
00:46:18,126 --> 00:46:19,361
"Ma Chao"

369
00:46:56,199 --> 00:46:58,400
This memorial tablet is reserved for you

370
00:47:02,138 --> 00:47:03,639
I've tidied up this place long ago

371
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,609
As I knew that you would come

372
00:47:12,448 --> 00:47:13,783
We rarely met but I truly hope

373
00:47:15,351 --> 00:47:18,087
This is not the place where we meet next time

374
00:47:24,696 --> 00:47:25,763
Brother...

375
00:47:28,533 --> 00:47:30,201
If I fail to return,

376
00:47:31,603 --> 00:47:35,073
Would you please rest my armor here?

377
00:47:35,807 --> 00:47:38,006
Zhao Zilong already thinking
about retiring from his career?

378
00:47:42,978 --> 00:47:44,913
I haven't even started mine yet

379
00:47:47,817 --> 00:47:50,854
Brother,
how long have we been in the army?

380
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:55,592
20 years since you were made one of
"The Five Tiger Generals"

381
00:47:57,294 --> 00:48:01,662
since the time we left Changshan,
32 years and 4 months

382
00:48:02,399 --> 00:48:05,636
Do you still remember what you
asked me when I first joined the army?

383
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:07,004
I remember

384
00:48:08,405 --> 00:48:10,007
I asked you why you wanted to join the army!

385
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:14,845
And you said that you wanted to
bring peace and start a family

386
00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:17,414
And yet it hasn't happened

387
00:48:19,918 --> 00:48:21,119
Not yet

388
00:48:26,058 --> 00:48:30,196
I've always been regarded as the one who
has achieved the least within Liu's army.

389
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:42,038
This is your very last battle

390
00:48:43,773 --> 00:48:49,340
Can you give me the chance to finish
this last mission together with you?

391
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:57,621
Would you?

392
00:49:52,745 --> 00:49:53,612
Prime Minister instructed

393
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,948
The first pouch should be open
when we come to a fork in the road.

394
00:50:02,988 --> 00:50:03,923
Prime Minister said

395
00:50:04,723 --> 00:50:07,859
Units of the two young
Generals and General Zilong

396
00:50:08,192 --> 00:50:09,897
Are to split into two groups
and go separate ways

397
00:50:10,398 --> 00:50:13,900
All troops shall proceed together
to seize Cao's six counties

398
00:50:17,538 --> 00:50:18,906
How can we split our forces?

399
00:50:20,141 --> 00:50:21,672
Zilong at His Majesty's service

400
00:50:22,207 --> 00:50:24,475
Though the stone-paved road is broad,
it's easy to be ambushed.

401
00:50:25,176 --> 00:50:26,811
May I suggest that I take this road

402
00:50:27,045 --> 00:50:28,680
while Zhang accompanies you on the rear

403
00:50:29,614 --> 00:50:31,015
I disagree.

404
00:50:31,316 --> 00:50:33,318
Guan, I fear that you will be too slow

405
00:50:33,818 --> 00:50:36,656
and fall behind enemy lines

406
00:50:37,424 --> 00:50:39,192
Your kind offers are appreciated

407
00:52:21,094 --> 00:52:25,133
How dare you intrude our border?

408
00:52:28,804 --> 00:52:31,240
At the presence of General Zhao Zilong of the
"The Five Tiger Generals"

409
00:52:32,007 --> 00:52:33,575
You worthless rats.
I suggest you to surrender!

410
00:52:34,543 --> 00:52:35,744
The Five Tiger Generals"

411
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,647
such antiquated fame!

412
00:52:39,181 --> 00:52:41,817
Zilong, unless you're eager to die

413
00:52:42,584 --> 00:52:44,019
Do you still belong to the battle field?

414
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,921
I suggest you go home

415
00:52:46,488 --> 00:52:48,657
And tend to trophies from your past victories

416
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:51,693
Son!

417
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,435
How dare you!

418
00:52:57,669 --> 00:52:58,902
Stop! I will go!

419
00:53:16,617 --> 00:53:18,619
Three of you, go fight with your brother

420
00:53:21,724 --> 00:53:22,325
Back off!

421
00:53:41,444 --> 00:53:42,378
Watch out General!

422
00:54:13,242 --> 00:54:14,076
General Han

423
00:54:14,378 --> 00:54:16,380
the Commander has ordered
that we must follow the battle plan

424
00:54:33,297 --> 00:54:35,399
Did you lure Zhao Zilong
into our trap as I ordered?

425
00:54:35,499 --> 00:54:36,233
Yes, Commander

426
00:54:59,623 --> 00:55:01,991
Deng, quickly find another route

427
00:55:02,325 --> 00:55:03,092
Yes, General!

428
00:55:21,313 --> 00:55:22,280
Deploy the war chariot!

429
00:55:38,465 --> 00:55:39,166
Fire!

430
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:40,367
Fire!

431
00:55:48,942 --> 00:55:51,443
The enemy has encircled us
and we can only escape westward

432
00:55:51,909 --> 00:55:53,844
Why is the enemy lying in ambush
in these desolate mountains

433
00:55:55,446 --> 00:55:56,680
There must be a traitor amongst us

434
00:55:56,981 --> 00:55:57,781
Cut the nonsense!

435
00:55:58,782 --> 00:56:01,852
Tell me, what is to our west?

436
00:56:03,287 --> 00:56:04,054
Phoenix Heights

437
00:56:12,131 --> 00:56:13,466
Withdraw to Phoenix Heights!

438
00:56:13,933 --> 00:56:14,600
Yes, General

439
00:56:41,496 --> 00:56:44,465
General Zhao, Congratulation for your success!

440
00:56:45,466 --> 00:56:48,733
I assume by now you have already
diverted Cao Ying's attention

441
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:51,203
For me to attack Cao's six countries

442
00:56:53,905 --> 00:56:56,607
I've ordered Guan and Zhang to proceed
in capturing Cao's six counties without you

443
00:56:56,807 --> 00:56:59,377
Please hold until back up arrives

444
00:57:00,948 --> 00:57:06,982
Once they have succeeded, their troops would
come to your aid to unify the country together.

445
00:57:09,857 --> 00:57:11,658
Before your forces set off,

446
00:57:11,992 --> 00:57:14,328
I already knew their Commander Ying

447
00:57:14,628 --> 00:57:17,498
Is the granddaughter of late Emperor Cao

448
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:21,167
She has inherited Cao's talent on the battlefield.

449
00:57:21,168 --> 00:57:25,005
You'll only have to hold out for
six hours against Cao Ying.

450
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:31,210
Guan and Zhang shall return to
eliminate Cao Ying troop with you.

451
00:57:42,421 --> 00:57:43,256
General!

452
00:57:48,661 --> 00:57:50,229
How could Prime Minister Zhuge
treat you like this?

453
00:57:51,364 --> 00:57:54,565
- General! General!
- General! General!

454
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:57,672
How can he do that?

455
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,008
How can he do that?

456
00:59:05,007 --> 00:59:06,675
Why am I treated this way?

457
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:16,754
Prime Minister Zhuge has always
followed his military agenda

458
00:59:28,533 --> 00:59:29,300
Brother...

459
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:36,237
Over all these years what
have we been fighting for?

460
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:50,854
Here they come!

461
01:00:41,272 --> 01:00:42,607
Commander, you have foresight

462
01:00:42,907 --> 01:00:44,909
General Zilong has chosen to
make his stand at Phoenix Heights

463
01:00:45,877 --> 01:00:48,946
General Han,
send my order to the forces in the Six Counties

464
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:52,116
They are to adopt a defensive
strategy and never attack

465
01:00:52,984 --> 01:00:57,720
So that they cannot spare time to
rescue their beloved General Zilong

466
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,730
To triumph over the Liu's army,
we need to break their spirit

467
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:10,370
What better way is there than to
defeat their "Invincible General"

468
01:01:11,104 --> 01:01:12,505
Once we capture General Zhao Zilong,

469
01:01:12,772 --> 01:01:17,341
We shall take advantage of the victory

470
01:01:18,311 --> 01:01:21,611
Your military strategy is most impressive.
I remain at your service!

471
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:24,347
Dispatch the cavalry and
launch an attack immediately

472
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:28,685
Yes, Commander

473
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,201
Retreat!

474
01:03:18,197 --> 01:03:21,366
We should never have
underestimated our old General Zilong

475
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:28,809
Commander,
perhaps he was not wounded by my son

476
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:30,845
Don't speculate

477
01:03:31,779 --> 01:03:35,247
By hiding, it doesn't mean that he is hurt.
By appearing, he could still be wounded.

478
01:03:35,716 --> 01:03:39,220
Either way, we will find out soon enough

479
01:03:39,987 --> 01:03:45,191
I Promise you,
I won't let your four sons died for nothing.

480
01:04:06,146 --> 01:04:10,683
My sons...

481
01:04:14,387 --> 01:04:18,358
Your family has made such great
contributions to the Kingdom of Cao

482
01:04:20,829 --> 01:04:26,334
I shall request His Majesty to
bestow an honorable title on you

483
01:04:29,804 --> 01:04:31,273
My General, please take care of yourself

484
01:04:33,141 --> 01:04:36,011
Though you have lost four of your sons today

485
01:04:36,311 --> 01:04:38,113
In return you've gained a daughter

486
01:04:39,514 --> 01:04:41,616
Please take me as your daughter

487
01:04:43,084 --> 01:04:44,886
I don't deserve such honor

488
01:04:46,557 --> 01:04:47,291
Father!

489
01:04:50,961 --> 01:04:52,763
My Commander

490
01:04:55,499 --> 01:04:59,036
How could I possibly repay your great kindness

491
01:05:27,763 --> 01:05:28,965
War is cruel

492
01:05:29,765 --> 01:05:32,401
but the soldiers are innocent

493
01:05:33,836 --> 01:05:35,371
Same goes for the enemy soldiers

494
01:05:36,606 --> 01:05:39,342
Send the bodies of the enemy
soldiers back to Zhao Zilong

495
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,131
Cao Ying is truly sinister

496
01:07:07,432 --> 01:07:08,634
Now she has managed to
weaken our soldiers spirit.

497
01:07:08,735 --> 01:07:09,934
What should we do?

498
01:07:14,305 --> 01:07:16,207
She definitely lives up to her
grandfather Cao's expectations

499
01:07:17,675 --> 01:07:19,410
Not only with her military skills

500
01:07:20,678 --> 01:07:22,346
but also with her scheming

501
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:28,553
Good.
Brother.

502
01:07:30,655 --> 01:07:31,324
Zilong...

503
01:07:34,261 --> 01:07:35,962
I want to give Cao Ying a
gift for her thoughtfulness

504
01:08:17,002 --> 01:08:19,237
Here is a gift from our General to the
Commander in return for her kindness

505
01:08:51,636 --> 01:08:52,539
Our General Zilong said that years ago,

506
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,574
Cao failed to captured him
and Cao's sword was taken.

507
01:08:55,675 --> 01:08:58,675
This sword has remained with us all these years.

508
01:08:58,778 --> 01:09:01,681
Today, General Zilong rewards you
with it on your grandfather's behalf

509
01:09:02,048 --> 01:09:06,086
Hope you can learn from the past
and not lose this sword to him again

510
01:09:14,761 --> 01:09:15,295
Take him!

511
01:09:15,396 --> 01:09:16,296
Yes!

512
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,849
Envoys should never be harmed in war

513
01:09:58,639 --> 01:10:01,843
Poised as a mountain and
unpredictable like the ying and yang

514
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:05,646
Grandfather,
General Zilong is truly a great opponent

515
01:10:15,389 --> 01:10:16,626
Commander!

516
01:10:18,161 --> 01:10:21,330
Commander, there is also a good news for you.

517
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:44,753
The Commander of Cao's Kingdom

518
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:48,323
requests a duel with
General Zilong of Liu's Kingdom

519
01:10:49,725 --> 01:10:50,526
Get my steed ready

520
01:10:51,994 --> 01:10:52,561
General!

521
01:10:53,128 --> 01:10:54,429
We can stall no further

522
01:10:56,165 --> 01:10:57,699
once we show a sign of weakness

523
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,804
Minister Zhuge probably don't know.

524
01:10:59,905 --> 01:11:01,670
We have been surrounded
by this many enemies

525
01:11:04,039 --> 01:11:06,308
Let's hope we can stall the enemy
until our rescue force arrive

526
01:11:52,021 --> 01:11:55,623
General Zilong, I am sure you have been
waiting for aid from Guan and Zhang

527
01:11:59,329 --> 01:12:03,466
Here is a small gift as a token of my gratitude
for your return of my grandfather's sword

528
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,510
"Guan"

529
01:12:15,413 --> 01:12:17,916
I wished to return the remains
of Guan and Zhang to you

530
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:21,116
But what was left of them were bits
and pieces far beyond recognition

531
01:12:21,683 --> 01:12:24,353
I should have killed Cao Cao last time

532
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:27,222
It's all my fault

533
01:12:38,903 --> 01:12:40,971
Even if I don't have a single man left

534
01:12:42,873 --> 01:12:44,909
Cao's army will never be able
to take over Shu Kingdom

535
01:12:45,442 --> 01:12:48,913
My grandfather regretted
he'd never captured you

536
01:12:49,613 --> 01:12:52,149
Today I shall assume his
challenge in honor of him

537
01:14:39,193 --> 01:14:40,055
Don't panic!

538
01:14:40,156 --> 01:14:42,061
Your big brother will save you

539
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:52,040
Zilong!

540
01:15:11,923 --> 01:15:12,724
Commander!

541
01:15:17,996 --> 01:15:19,500
Your fighting skill

542
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:22,069
does not match your grandfather

543
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:24,304
Come back when you are ready

544
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,570
Commander!
You...

545
01:16:12,518 --> 01:16:13,288
Go get a chair

546
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:22,430
Zilong...

547
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:23,264
General...

548
01:16:31,639 --> 01:16:36,478
Go quickly and check on Cao Ying. Go now!

549
01:16:37,011 --> 01:16:40,448
Allow me to remove your armor
so that I can pull out the arrow

550
01:16:45,755 --> 01:16:49,492
I've never taken off my armor during battle

551
01:16:55,562 --> 01:16:59,233
If I do, my troops will know that I'm hurt

552
01:17:01,368 --> 01:17:03,270
And they'll be unsettled

553
01:17:18,487 --> 01:17:20,222
Do not let Cao Ying know about it

554
01:17:23,425 --> 01:17:24,160
Go and check it.

555
01:18:02,096 --> 01:18:04,801
This is the map in your heart

556
01:18:11,641 --> 01:18:13,610
Zilong, we've definitely come very far

557
01:18:17,347 --> 01:18:18,481
Do you still remember?

558
01:18:19,483 --> 01:18:23,954
You said that you will make yourself
live in the hearts of the people

559
01:18:32,698 --> 01:18:34,366
You had also said that

560
01:18:36,935 --> 01:18:39,638
by the time we complete a circle on the map,

561
01:18:40,839 --> 01:18:42,608
We shall have peace in our country

562
01:18:43,876 --> 01:18:48,674
But after years of battle,
And now that we're back at Phoenix Heights,

563
01:18:50,246 --> 01:18:51,747
Do we have peace in our country?

564
01:19:13,171 --> 01:19:15,907
Father, are you willing to give me a hand?

565
01:19:18,042 --> 01:19:21,712
Commander,
I am willing to pay you my debt of gratitude

566
01:19:22,246 --> 01:19:25,552
Great.
Grant my father one hundred of our finest horses

567
01:19:25,819 --> 01:19:27,754
I vow to kill the enemy till my very last breath

568
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:49,239
Zilong, will you surrender?

569
01:19:51,475 --> 01:19:52,108
Surrender?

570
01:19:59,056 --> 01:19:59,856
General!

571
01:19:59,857 --> 01:20:00,457
General!

572
01:20:01,058 --> 01:20:01,658
General!

573
01:20:01,659 --> 01:20:02,659
General!

574
01:20:07,959 --> 01:20:08,659
General!

575
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:11,962
Ying's forces are already in action.
And They're preparing for the next onslaught

576
01:20:27,882 --> 01:20:31,485
General, we are sorry that we cannot
serve you as long as we wish

577
01:20:36,821 --> 01:20:41,959
You have always taught us that it's
an honor for a man to die in battle

578
01:20:44,962 --> 01:20:46,797
I will not forget to repay you
for your outstanding leadership

579
01:20:47,431 --> 01:20:51,037
We will charge downhill to take down Cao Ying

580
01:20:59,112 --> 01:21:03,550
We have lived as Zilong's men.
And shall die as Zilong's ghosts

581
01:21:05,485 --> 01:21:11,724
General, We the four deputies
await for your command!

582
01:21:18,733 --> 01:21:24,539
If I Zhao Zilong can't lead you to victory,

583
01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:33,245
I shall not let you die without honor

584
01:21:34,213 --> 01:21:35,314
Listen

585
01:21:39,318 --> 01:21:42,957
Go and fight for our Great Kingdom of Shu

586
01:21:47,328 --> 01:21:49,996
I shall follow closely behind

587
01:25:37,062 --> 01:25:43,668
I would rather fail everyone in the
world than to allow them to fail me

588
01:26:27,746 --> 01:26:32,485
Long Live the Great Kingdom of Cao

589
01:26:32,718 --> 01:26:35,888
Long Live the Great Kingdom of Liu!

590
01:27:20,667 --> 01:27:28,208
I vow to guard Phoenix Heights to my death.

591
01:27:30,143 --> 01:27:32,475
It was me who informed Cao's army.

592
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:35,315
And helped Cao Ying to
lead you to Phoenix Heights

593
01:27:38,251 --> 01:27:41,056
They promised to make me
a General in Cao's army

594
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:54,700
I'm sorry, it was me
who've betrayed you

595
01:27:57,770 --> 01:27:59,338
Since you have betrayed me,

596
01:28:03,742 --> 01:28:13,087
Why did you save me
while I was fighting Cao Ying?

597
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:18,326
Why?

598
01:28:20,127 --> 01:28:21,662
You have always called me brother

599
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:26,133
Yet I've gained nothing!

600
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:34,375
You've what it takes to be a great general

601
01:28:36,346 --> 01:28:38,781
But I am getting nowhere

602
01:28:39,015 --> 01:28:40,282
I've accomplished nothing all these years

603
01:28:42,085 --> 01:28:43,819
You asked me about
what we are fighting for

604
01:28:45,054 --> 01:28:48,558
I will tell you, I fought for myself

605
01:28:54,561 --> 01:28:59,499
What I want is simply that when I return home

606
01:29:00,267 --> 01:29:05,140
When the folks of Changshan think about Zilong.
They will also think about Pingan!

607
01:29:07,046 --> 01:29:09,314
You think I made this far

608
01:29:11,048 --> 01:29:17,085
In fact,
we have both been going around in circles

609
01:29:18,287 --> 01:29:20,722
I only believe that fate in within my control

610
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:24,226
In the end, we are all bound to fate

611
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:28,764
Therefore all victories and
defeats no longer matter

612
01:29:32,203 --> 01:29:35,906
I Zhao Zilong,
The title of "Invincible General" means nothing.

613
01:29:36,907 --> 01:29:39,243
Winners and losers are just
roles we were given to play.

614
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:45,613
Brother...

615
01:29:47,248 --> 01:29:50,017
Take this armor off me

616
01:30:52,216 --> 01:30:56,854
It is time for me to proceed
with my last mission

617
01:31:00,691 --> 01:31:05,062
Zilong, Do you blame me for
treating you as my competitor?

618
01:31:07,898 --> 01:31:12,837
No, you'll always be my beloved brother

619
01:31:22,014 --> 01:31:29,021
With blessings from the Buddha,
I vow to capture Zhao Zilong alive today

620
01:31:33,192 --> 01:31:37,026
Tell the Prime Minister that I have
recovered the long lost memories of the past

621
01:31:38,428 --> 01:31:41,865
To people of Changshan,
please tell that I have only gone

622
01:31:44,067 --> 01:31:45,601
around in a big circle in my lifetime

623
01:31:48,673 --> 01:31:49,441
Brother

624
01:31:54,713 --> 01:31:56,581
Please beat the drum military for me one last time..

625
01:32:27,214 --> 01:32:28,846
When our missions are accomplished

626
01:32:29,413 --> 01:32:30,314
We shall meet again

627
01:32:49,368 --> 01:32:51,303
Zhao Zilong!

628
01:33:33,645 --> 01:33:35,914
That was the last time I saw Zhao Zilong.

629
01:33:37,618 --> 01:33:39,786
Years later,
the Three Kingdoms were finally united

630
01:33:40,153 --> 01:33:43,521
Not by Wei, Not by Wu or Not by Shu,

631
01:33:44,258 --> 01:33:45,825
But under a new "Jin" Dynasty

632
01:33:48,295 --> 01:33:50,297
How many things before and after"

633
01:33:50,864 --> 01:33:53,066
"All melt into gossip and laughter"
